Receipts for Lovely Loveseats - Learn Python 3
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

Magic 8-Ball - Learn Python 3
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:
Yes - definitely; It is decidedly so; Without a doubt; Reply hazy, try again; Ask again later; Better not tell you now; My sources say no; Outlook not so good; Very doubtful
If you’re up for some more challenges, try implementing the following features to your program.
So far, the Magic 8-Ball provides 9 possible fortunes. Try to add a few more possible answers to the program.
What if the asker does not provide a name, such that the value of name is an empty string?
What if the question string is empty? If the user does not provide any question, then the Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune, otherwise, the fabric of reality is at risk!
