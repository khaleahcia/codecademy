Hello World section

Block Letters
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.
Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

Control Flow section

Magic 8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:
Yes - definitely; It is decidedly so; Without a doubt; Reply hazy, try again; Ask again later; Better not tell you now; My sources say no; Outlook not so good; Very doubtful
If you’re up for some more challenges, try implementing the following features to your program.
So far, the Magic 8-Ball provides 9 possible fortunes. Try to add a few more possible answers to the program.
What if the asker does not provide a name, such that the value of name is an empty string?
What if the question string is empty? If the user does not provide any question, then the Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune, otherwise, the fabric of reality is at risk!

Sal's Shipping
Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.
In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:
Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
Provided table with Ground Shipping prices.
Ground Shipping Premium Flat charge: $125.00
Provided table with Drone Shipping prices.
Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.
