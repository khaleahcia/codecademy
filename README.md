*******************************

**Hello World**
Get started with Python syntax in this lesson and then create a point of sale system for a furniture store!

1. Block Letters
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from individual characters.
Write a Python program called initials.py that displays the initials of your name in block letters as shown and dip your toes into ASCII art.

2. Receipts for Lovely Loveseats
We’ve decided to pursue the dream of small-business ownership and open up a furniture store called Lovely Loveseats for Neat Suites on Fleet Street. With our newfound knowledge of Python programming, we’re going to build a system to help speed up the process of creating receipts for your customers.
In this project, we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture store’s catalog in variables. You will then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.

**Control Flow**
Learn how to build control flow into your python code by including if, else, and elif statements. Expect to learn all you need to know about boolean variables and logical operators.

3. Magic 8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.
Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.
We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:
Yes - definitely; It is decidedly so; Without a doubt; Reply hazy, try again; Ask again later; Better not tell you now; My sources say no; Outlook not so good; Very doubtful
If you’re up for some more challenges, try implementing the following features to your program.
So far, the Magic 8-Ball provides 9 possible fortunes. Try to add a few more possible answers to the program.
What if the asker does not provide a name, such that the value of name is an empty string?
What if the question string is empty? If the user does not provide any question, then the Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune, otherwise, the fabric of reality is at risk!

4. Sal's Shipping
Sal runs the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area, Sal’s Shippers. Sal wants to make sure that every single one of his customers has the best, and most affordable experience shipping their packages.
In this project, you’ll build a program that will take the weight of a package and determine the cheapest way to ship that package using Sal’s Shippers.
Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:
Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.
Provided table with Ground Shipping prices.
Ground Shipping Premium Flat charge: $125.00
Provided table with Drone Shipping prices.
Write a shipping.py Python program that asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.

**Lists**
Learn about lists, a data structure in Python used to store ordered groups of data.

5. Gradebook
You are a student and you are trying to organize your subjects and grades using Python. Let’s explore what we’ve learned about lists to organize your subjects and scores.

6. Len's Slice
You work at Len’s Slice, a new pizza joint in the neighborhood. You are going to use your knowledge of Python lists to organize some of your sales data.

**Loops**
Loops are structures that let you repeat Python code over and over. Learn how to read loops and write them to solve your own problems.

7. Carly's Clippers
You are the Data Analyst at Carly’s Clippers, the newest hair salon on the block. Your job is to go through the lists of data that have been collected in the past couple of weeks. You will be calculating some important metrics that Carly can use to plan out the operation of the business for the rest of the month.
You have been provided with three lists:
hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carly’s Clippers.
prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list.
last_week: the number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the last week.
Each index in hairstyles corresponds to an associated index in prices and last_week.
For example, The hairstyle "bouffant" has an associated price of 30 from the prices list, and was purchased 2 times in the last week as shown in the last_week list. Each of these elements are in the first index of their respective lists.

**Functions**
Learn about code reuse with Python functions. Apply that knowledge to create functions for famous physics formulas.

8. Getting Ready for Physics Class
You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

**Strings**
Learn all about the Python string object. Figure out how to automatically create, rearrange, reassign, disassemble, and reassemble blocks of text!

9. Thread Shed
You’ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.
Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.
All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.

**Dictionaries**
Learn all about the Python dictionary structure and how to create and use key-value pairs in your code.

10. Scrabble
In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. You will use dictionaries to organize players, words, and points.
There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!

**Files**
Learn how to work with files in an automated way! Investigate the properties of text, CSV, and JSON files by reading and writing to them!

11. Hacking The Fender
The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. You must acquire access to The Fender‘s systems, you must update his "passwords.txt" file to scramble the secret data. The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.
Use your knowledge of working with Python files to retrieve, manipulate, obscure, and create data in your quest for justice. Work with CSV files and other text files in this exploration of the strength of Python file programming.

**Classes**
Learn about the differences between data types in Python and how to create your own classes, objects, and interfaces.

12. Basta Fazoolin'
You’ve started a position as the lead programmer for the family-style Italian restaurant Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart. The restaurant has been doing fantastically and seen a lot of growth lately. You’ve been hired to keep things organized.
